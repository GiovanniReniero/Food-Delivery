# Food Delivery
###### A training exercise to help understand Model, View, Controller structure. CSV database also used. 
###### The app simulates a management system for orders and deliveries that something like a restaurant might use. There are two types of users: manager and delivery person. As a manager one has access to a menu that includes full CRUD to the food menu, order menu, customer list and can list which orders have been delivered and which ones not. A delivery person may only view their list of orders and mark the same as either completed or pending. 

#### Technologies
###### The code is written in Ruby version 2.6.6

#### Setup
###### Needs Ruby environment. Download all folders: "ruby app/app.rb" to run the code. 
###### The app interface appears in the Terminal and prompts the user for a sign in.  Depending on the sign in credentials a user is greeted either as a manager or a delivery person. Gio/secret for manager. Mary/secret for delivery person.

#### To do list
###### Some extra work might include
1. Refactoring where possible

#### Status
###### Project is: completed
